# AI-Driven DCA Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The AI-Driven Debt Collection Agency (DCA) Management System is a smart, centralized platform designed to transform manual and fragmented debt collection processes into an intelligent, automated, and transparent system.

The solution leverages automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics to improve recovery efficiency, enforce governance, and enable data-driven decision-making.
