# AI-Driven DCA Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The AI-Driven Debt Collection Agency (DCA) Management System is a smart, centralized platform designed to transform manual and fragmented debt collection processes into an intelligent, automated, and transparent system.

The solution leverages automation, artificial intelligence, and analytics to improve recovery efficiency, enforce governance, and enable data-driven decision-making.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Large enterprises manage thousands of overdue customer accounts through external debt collection agencies.  
Currently, this process relies on spreadsheets, emails, and manual follow-ups, resulting in delayed recoveries, poor visibility, weak accountability, and frequent escalations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Centralize debt collection operations
- Automate case allocation and tracking
- Use Artificial Intelligence for prioritization and recovery prediction
- Improve governance, transparency, and scalability

---

## 💡 Our Solution
We propose an **AI-driven DCA Management Platform** that acts as a control tower for debt collection operations by combining automation, intelligence, and real-time monitoring.
